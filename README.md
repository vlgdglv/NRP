# Next Row Prediction

This is the official repo for Next Row Prediction for Autoregressive Image Model.

We explore a lightweight and elegant approach to enable row-wise parallel prediction in image autoregressive models, without modifying the base model architecture.


## Motivation
AR models are too slow.

## Core Method
Still thinking.

## Inference Usage
Not available until we work out this method.

## Status
Initialized.
